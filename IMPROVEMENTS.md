# Portfolio Website Improvements

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **"What I Do" Section Layout**
**Problem:** Cards were not properly centered and responsive
**Solution:**
- Added proper centering wrapper with flexbox
- Made card widths responsive (18rem on mobile → 22rem on desktop)
- Adjusted translations for mobile devices (smaller offsets)
- Improved glassmorphism effects with better contrast
- Fixed text sizing for better mobile readability
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling

### 2. **Content Centering Across All Devices**
**Problem:** Content appeared left-aligned when opening in new tabs/browsers
**Solution:**
- Added `width: 100%` to body and #root elements
- Ensured all sections use proper `container mx-auto` classes
- Fixed viewport constraints with `overflow-x-hidden`
- Removed conflicting flex/place-items from body
- All content now properly centered on all screen sizes

### 3. **Static Website Optimization**
**Enhancements Made:**
- ✅ Production-ready build configuration
- ✅ Proper HTML meta tags (viewport, description)
- ✅ Dark theme class on html element
- ✅ SEO-friendly title and meta description
- ✅ Optimized for static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- ✅ No runtime dependencies needed
- ✅ Single-page application structure
